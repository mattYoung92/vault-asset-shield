# ETH Conversion Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The investment transaction was sending incorrect amounts to the blockchain:
- **Problem**: USD amount was being converted directly to wei (e.g., $100 → 100 ETH)
- **Impact**: $100 investment was being sent as 100 ETH (~$350,000)

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Added ETH Price Constant
```typescript
const ETH_PRICE_USD = 3500; // ETH price in USD
```

### 2. USD to ETH Conversion
```typescript
const amountInEth = amount / ETH_PRICE_USD; // Convert USD to ETH
```

### 3. Updated Transaction Amount
```typescript
// Before:
Math.floor(amount * 1e18) // Treated USD as ETH

// After:
const amountInWei = Math.floor(amountInEth * 1e18); // Correct conversion
```

### 4. Display ETH Equivalent
Added ETH amount display in the review step:
```
Investment Amount (USD): $100
Investment Amount (ETH): 0.0286 ETH
```

## 📊 Conversion Examples

| USD Amount | ETH Amount | Wei Amount |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| $100 | 0.0286 ETH | 28,571,428,571,428,571 wei |
| $1,000 | 0.2857 ETH | 285,714,285,714,285,714 wei |
| $10,000 | 2.8571 ETH | 2,857,142,857,142,857,143 wei |

## 🎯 Result

Now when a user invests:
- ✅ **$100 USD** = **0.0286 ETH** (not 100 ETH)
- ✅ **Correct on-chain amount** sent to smart contract
- ✅ **Clear display** showing both USD and ETH amounts
- ✅ **Realistic pricing** based on $3,500 ETH price

## 🔄 Investment Flow

1. User enters amount in USD (e.g., $100)
2. System converts to ETH: $100 / $3,500 = 0.0286 ETH
3. System converts to wei: 0.0286 × 10^18 = 28,571,428,571,428,571 wei
4. Transaction sent to blockchain with correct amount
5. Review screen shows both USD and ETH amounts

- **`src/components/InvestModal.tsx`**:
  - Added `ETH_PRICE_USD` constant
  - Added `amountInEth` conversion
  - Updated `executeTransaction` to use wei conversion
  - Added ETH amount display in review step

## 🎉 Impact

Users can now:
- ✅ Invest realistic amounts (e.g., $100 = 0.0286 ETH)
- ✅ See clear USD and ETH amounts before confirming
- ✅ Send correct amounts to the blockchain
- ✅ Avoid accidentally sending massive amounts
