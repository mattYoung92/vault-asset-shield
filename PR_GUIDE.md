### 📝 Pull Request Template

```markdown
# 🚀 Remove FHE Encryption and Implement End-to-End Functionality

## 📋 Summary
This PR removes FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) from the smart contract and implements complete end-to-end functionality between frontend and blockchain.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Smart Contract (`contracts/VaultAssetShield.sol`)
- ✅ Removed all FHE encryption types (`euint32`, `ebool`, `externalEuint32`)
- ✅ Replaced with standard Solidity types (`uint256`, `bool`)
- ✅ Updated all function signatures to remove encryption parameters
- ✅ Added new getter functions: `getAssetValue`, `getAssetQuantity`, `getPortfolioTotalValue`
- ✅ Simplified contract logic for better efficiency and lower gas costs

### Frontend Integration (`src/`)
- ✅ Updated contract ABI with all new functions
- ✅ Enhanced `useContract.ts` hooks for new functionality
- ✅ Modified `AssetCard.tsx` to display real contract data
- ✅ Updated `InvestModal.tsx` for actual blockchain transactions
- ✅ Integrated `Assets.tsx` with contract data reading
- ✅ Added user asset management capabilities

### New Features Added
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for assets and portfolios
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization between frontend and contract
- ✅ Transaction execution capabilities (deposit, withdraw, transfer)
- ✅ User reputation and balance management
- ✅ Deployment and testing scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ Smart contract functionality tested
- ✅ Frontend integration verified
- ✅ End-to-end workflow validated
- ✅ All existing features maintained

## 📊 Impact
- **Performance**: Improved gas efficiency by removing FHE operations
